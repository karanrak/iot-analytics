Hand simulation includes a file with hand simulation task for the simulator we will build in upcoming projects

Basic simulation includes files that can build on and replicate the hand simulation. Furthermore, there is an added component of randomness to ensure that we can simulate real world scenarios. Graphing code also included.

Advanced simulation adds a component of maintaining the messages in separate queues and storing them in batches. This data is then used to calculate the 95th percentile and mean distributions along with their confidence intervals. New Graphing module included to better understand the results. Observations are detailed in the pdf.
